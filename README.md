To install:

1. Download postgresql https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
with User: postgresql and Password: admin 
//Technically, you can choose any user or password, but choosing these would mean not having to modify the project every time you want to run it :)
2. Download pgadmin 4 https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
3. Download IntellijIDEA https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
4. Download Java 1.8 (you need an Oracle account, good luck)
5. Download Gradle 4.6 (if intellij brings a newer version, downgrade to this one)
6. Run the project
